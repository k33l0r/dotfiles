 * A new mode for push, "simple", which is a cross between "current"
   and "upstream", has been introduced. "git push" without any refspec
   will push the current branch out to the same name at the remote
   repository only when it is set to track the branch with the same
   name over there.  The plan is to make this mode the new default
   value when push.default is not configured.
