Matt's dot files
================

Just my dot files. Use them if you can...

## Installation

There's a Rake task that you can use to install the appropriate symlinks, but
it's pretty crude and assumes some things (for example that Oh My Zsh is
installed in `~/.oh-my-zsh`)

### RVM, Readline, and OpenSSL

Make sure you have Readline and OpenSSL installed via RVM:

* <https://rvm.io/packages/readline/>
* <https://rvm.io/packages/openssl/>

## Caveats

* Some of the configuration (e.g. the [RVM](https://rvm.io/) configuration in .rvmrc) might be specific to my set-up.
* I don't take responsibility for anything at all
